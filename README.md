# bonaso-data-viewer
Conceptual project creating a system for interacting with a database for my organization.

Important Notes:

Organizations:
By default, users will only be able to see content (forms, responses, etc.) related to their organization. The exception to this is users with the organization 'BONASO' (id=3) will be allowed to view all content, since BONASO is the managing organization.
